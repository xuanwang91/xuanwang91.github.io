I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.vt.edu/) at Virginia Tech (VT). I am also a faculty member of the [Sanghani Center for Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics](https://sanghani.cs.vt.edu/) at VT. I was a recipient of the **NSF CAREER Award 2025**, Nvidia Academic Grant 2025, Cisco Research Award 2025, NSF NAIRR Pilot Award 2024 - 2025, and NAACL Best Demo Paper Award 2021. I received my Ph.D. in [Computer Science](http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/) from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) under the supervision of Dr. [Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/). During my Ph.D. study, I also worked at IBM Research as a summer intern. I received my M.S. in [Statistics](https://stat.illinois.edu/) and my M.S. in [Biochemistry](https://mcb.illinois.edu/departments/biochemistry/) from UIUC. I received my B.S. in [Biological Science](https://life.tsinghua.edu.cn/) from Tsinghua University, China. Here is my full [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bg0LmchHziBMgvhKw2NGE-p_Bg4ufyQH/view?usp=sharing).


## Research Interests
My primary research interests are Natural Language Processing, Data Mining, AI for Sciences, and AI for Healthcare. Some current research directions include:

- **Natural Language Understanding with Limited Supervision**:
  - Information extraction, knowledge graph construction, text classification, ...
  - Weakly-supervised/few-shot/zero-shot learning
- **Complex Reasoning and Planning with Language Model Agents**:
  - Complex reasoning with large language models (multi-hop, long-context, ...)
  - Multi-agent large language models for reasoning and planning
  - Efficient small language models for reasoning and planning
- **Multi-Modal Science Foundation Models (FMs)**:
  - Systematic integration of multi-modal FMs
  - Interpretability, explainability, and causal inference of science FMs
  - Text data, multi-omics data, brain signal data, ...

## My Schedule

You can find my schedule [here](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/7a9db64927ad4b31ac057a71aa1a21f4@vt.edu/36019279cd6b4fb78bef49139b5b4e834236640486942120667/calendar.html). The "Week" view will present you the details of slots.
 

## Prospective Students
My lab at Virginia Tech has openings for **PhD/Master students and Post-doc researchers** and research internship opportunities for **undergrad students**. We are looking for students with a strong background in <span style="color:blue">NLP, data mining, deep learning, or bioinformatics</span>.

Please email me (with your CV) if you're interested in working with me. Due to the high volume of emails, I may not be able to respond to every one I receive. 
- For **prospective PhD/MS students** outside of VT, please include my name as one of your interested faculty members in your graduate application. This will make it easier for me to locate your application during the review process.
- For **current PhD/MS/undergraduate students** at VT, the best way to learn more about our research is to attend my classes, visit my office hours, or engage with my graduate students in DDS 362 and 364.
- For **prospective Post-docs**, please check out this prestigious [Virginia Tech Presidential Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.research.vt.edu/about/postdoctoral-associates/virginia-tech-presidential-postdoctoral-fellowships.html). If you're interested in joining our research group, I would be happy to help you with the application process.
