I am an Assistant Professor in the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.vt.edu/) at Virginia Tech (VT). I am also a faculty member of the [Sanghani Center for Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics](https://sanghani.cs.vt.edu/) at VT.

I received my Ph.D. in [Computer Science](http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/) from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) under the supervision of Dr. [Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/). During my Ph.D. study, I also worked at IBM Research as a summer intern. I received my M.S. in [Statistics](https://stat.illinois.edu/) and my M.S. in [Biochemistry](https://mcb.illinois.edu/departments/biochemistry/) from UIUC. I received my B.S. in [Biological Science](https://life.tsinghua.edu.cn/) from Tsinghua University, China.


## Research Interests
My primary research interests are in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Data Mining (DM). I am specifically interested in developing principled data-driven approaches with light human effort for effective and scalable model learning.

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
  - Information extraction, knowledge graph construction, text classification, …
  - Weakly-supervised/few-shot/zero-shot learning
- **Fact-checking and Trustworthy NLP**:
  - Fact-checking for generative large language models
  - Trustworthy large language models: groundedness, confidence, explainability, …
- **AI for Sciences; AI for Healthcare**:
  - Large language models for sciences and healthcare
  - Brain large language models
  - Multi-omics large language models

## My Schedule

You can find my schedule [here](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/7a9db64927ad4b31ac057a71aa1a21f4@vt.edu/36019279cd6b4fb78bef49139b5b4e834236640486942120667/calendar.html). The "Week" view will present you the details of slots.
 

## Prospective Students
My lab at Virginia Tech has openings for **PhD/Master students and Post-doc researchers** and research internship opportunities for **undergrad students**. We are looking for students with a strong background in <span style="color:blue">NLP, data mining, deep learning, or bioinformatics</span>.

Please email me if you're interested in working with me. **In your email**, please include the following items:
- Title as "Prospective Student: YourName - YourAffliation"
- Briefly introduce what research problem you are interested in.
- Briefly introduce yourself, including education background, research experiences, and programming skills.
- Briefly explain your motivations and expectations of working with me.
- Include a PDF version of your CV.

Due to the high volume of emails, I may not be able to respond to every one I receive. 
- For **prospective PhD/MS students** outside of VT, please include my name as one of your interested faculty members in your graduate application. This will make it easier for me to locate your application during the review process.
- For **current PhD/MS/undergraduate students** at VT, the best way to learn more about our research is to attend my classes, visit my office hours, or engage with my graduate students in DDS 362 and 364.
- For **prospective Post-docs**, please check out this prestigious [Virginia Tech Presidential Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.research.vt.edu/about/postdoctoral-associates/virginia-tech-presidential-postdoctoral-fellowships.html). If you're interested in joining our research group, I would be happy to help you with the application process.
