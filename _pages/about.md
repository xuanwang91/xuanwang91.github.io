I am an Assistant Professor in the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.vt.edu/) at Virginia Tech (VT). I am also a faculty member of the [Sanghani Center for Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics](https://sanghani.cs.vt.edu/) at VT.

I received my Ph.D. in [Computer Science](http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/) from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) under the supervision of Dr. [Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/). During my Ph.D. study, I also worked at IBM Research as a summer intern. I received my M.S. in [Statistics](https://stat.illinois.edu/) and my M.S. in [Biochemistry](https://mcb.illinois.edu/departments/biochemistry/) from UIUC. I received my B.S. in [Biological Science](https://life.tsinghua.edu.cn/) from Tsinghua University, China.


## Research Interests
My primary research interests are in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Data Mining (DM). I am specifically interested in developing principled data-driven approaches with light human effort for effective and scalable model learning.

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
  - Information extraction, knowledge graph construction, text classification, …
  - Weakly-supervised/few-shot/zero-shot learning
- **Fact-checking and trustworthy NLP**:
  - Fact-checking for LLM generation
  - Trustworthiness: explainability, robustness, privacy, …
- **AI for sciences; AI for healthcare**:
  - Brain Large Language Models
  - Multi-omics Large Language Models
  - Personalization of Large Language Models

## News and Highlights
- **(6/7/23)** We are grateful to receive a new grant from the Center for Health Behaviors Research at Fralin Biomedical Research Institute to support our research on AI-guided behavioral health modifier prediction for fetal growth disorder detection.
- **(5/11/23)** We are grateful to receive a new grant from Commonwealth Cyber Initiative (CCI) to support our research on trustworthy multimodal machine learning in healthcare.
- **(5/1/23)** Two papers are accepted by **ACL 2023**. Congratulations to all the authors!
- **(1/1/23)** I started a new journey as an Assistant Professor in **CS@VT**.

## Prospective Students
My lab at Virginia Tech has openings for **PhD students** and research internship opportunities for **master/undergrad students**. We are looking for students with a strong background in <span style="color:blue">NLP, data mining, deep learning, or bioinformatics</span>.

Please email me if you're interested in working with me. **In your email**, please include the following items:
- Title as "Prospective Student: YourName - YourAffliation"
- Briefly introduce what research problem you are interested in.
- Briefly introduce yourself, including education background, research experiences, and programming skills.
- Briefly explain your motivations and expectations of working with me.
- Include a PDF version of your CV.

Due to the high column of emails, I may not be able to respond to every one I received. For prospective PhD/MS students, if you are interested in joining our group, please put my name as one of your interested faculty in your graduate application so that I can easily find your application during the review process. For undergraduates and MS students at VT, the best way to know more about our research is to take my classes and come to my office hours, or talk with my graduate students in DDS 362 and 364.
