I'm an Assistant Professor at UCSD jointly appointed by Computer Science and Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute. I obtained my Ph.D. from UIUC advised Prof. Jiawei Han in 2019. I received my B.E. from SJTU in 2014. I'm also a coach of the UCSD's ACM-ICPC team.

## Research Interests

I'm broadly interested in Data Mining Problems and Applications:
- Text Mining, Information Extraction, and Natural Language Processing
- Structured Mining in Large-Scale Text-Rich Networks
- Understanding and Improving Deep Neural Networks
- Interdisciplinary Applications (e.g., Biomedical, IoT, ...)

Most of my research focus on (1) developing principled data-driven approaches with light human effort and (2) building effective and robust machine learning models in an efficient way.

## Prospective Students

I'm actively recruiting students who are excited about doing fun research. My lab has openings for PhD students and research internship opportunities for master/undergrad students (UCSD or external). Please check the following items before sending me an email.

- **Applicants for UCSD PhD Program**: Please make sure that you have applied online and select my name as one of the faculty members that you wish to work with.
- **Research Internship Opportunities**:
    * **If you are currently at UCSD**: I only take students who (1) have relevant research experiences or have strong background in math/stats/physics; and (2) could devote enough time on research. Please highlight these in your email including a time plan.
    * **If you are not at UCSD** (e.g., Summer Internship): Visitors are mostly recommended by my collaborators and have their own funding support. The minimal duration of stay at UCSD is 12 weeks (preferably 6 months - 1 year). Please indicate the time range in your email.

**In your email**, please include the following items:
- Title as "Prospective Student: YourName - YourAffliation"
