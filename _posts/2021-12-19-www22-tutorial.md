Location: **Online, hosted by Lyon, France**


## Abstract:
This tutorial targets researchers and practitioners who are interested in natural language processing (NLP) technologies for scientific web mining. Exploring the vast amount of rapidly growing scientific literature available on the web is highly beneficial for scientific discovery. However, scientific web mining is particularly challenging due to the lack of specialized domain knowledge in natural language context, complex sentence structures in scientific writing, and multi-modal representations of scientific knowledge.

This tutorial presents a comprehensive overview of recent research and development on using NLP techniques for scientific web mining, focusing on the biomedical and chemistry domains. First, we introduce the motivation and unique challenges of web mining in the scientific domains. Then we discuss a set of methods that perform effective information extraction (named entity recognition, relation extraction, and event extraction), information retrieval (textual evidence retrieval, cross-modal molecule retrieval, and chemical reaction tracking) from scientific literature, and their applications on reaction prediction. Finally, we conclude our tutorial by demonstrating, on real-world datasets (COVID-19 and organic chemistry literature), how the information can be extracted and retrieved, and how they can assist further exploratory analysis. We also discuss the emerging research problems and future directions of using NLP techniques for scientific web mining.


## Tutorial Recording:
