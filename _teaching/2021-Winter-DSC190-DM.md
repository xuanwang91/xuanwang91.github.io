Online Lecturing
======

Due to the COVID-19, this course will be delivered over Zoom: [https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/97017584161](https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/97017584161)

Overview
======

This course mainly focuses on introducing current methods and models that are useful in analyzing and mining real-world data. It will cover frequent pattern mining, regression & classification, clustering, and representation learning. No previous background in machine learning is required, but all participants should be comfortable with programming, and with basic optimization and linear algebra. 

There is no textbook required, but here are some recommended readings:
- The classical data mining textbook "[Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques](https://books.google.com/books/about/Data_Mining_Concepts_and_Techniques.html?id=pQws07tdpjoC&source=kp_book_description)" by Jiawei Han et al.
- The classical data mining/machine learning book "[Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://books.google.com/books/about/Pattern_Recognition_and_Machine_Learning.html?id=HL4HrgEACAAJ&source=kp_book_description)" by Christopher M. Bishop
- The new "[Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/)" book by Aston Zhang et al.

Homework (24%)
======

Your lowest (of four) homework grades is dropped (or one homework can be skipped).

- **HW1: Concepts and Evaluations (8%).** This homework mainly focuses on the data mining concepts and how to evaluate different tasks.
- **HW2: Regression and Classification (8%).** This homework mainly focuses on regression and classification tasks.
- **HW3: Cluster and Pattern Analysis (8%).** This homework mainly focuses on clustering methods and frequent pattern mining methods.
- **HW4: Applications (8%).** This homework mainly focuses on recommender system, text mining, and network mining.

Midterm (26%)
======

It is an open-book, take-home exam, which covers all lectures given before the Midterm. Most of the questions will be open-ended. Some of them might be slightly more difficult than homework. You will have 24 hours to complete the midterm, which is expected for about 2 hours.

- **Start**: Feb 11, 9:30 AM PT
- **End**: Feb 12, 9:30 AM PT
- Midterm problems download: TBD
- Please **make your submissions on Gradescope**.

Data Mining Challenge (25%)
======

It is a individual-based data mining competition with quantitative evaluation. The challenge runs **from Feb 4 0:00:01 AM to Feb 25 4:59:59 PM PT**. Note that the time displayed on Kaggle is in UTC, not PT.

- Challenge Statement, Dataset, and Details: TBD.
- Kaggle challenge link: TBD.

Project (25%)
======

Instructions for both choices are available here: TBD. Project **due on Mar 12**.

Here is a quick overview:
- **Choice 1: Team-Based Open-Ended Project**
    - 1 to 4 members per team. More members, higher expectation.
    - Define your own research problem and justify its importance
    - Come up with your hypothesis and find some datasets for verification
    - Design your own models or try a large variety of existing models
    - Write a 4 to 8 pages report (research-paper like)
    - Submit your codes
    - Up to 5% bonus for working demos/apps towards the total course grade.
- **Choice 2: Individual-Based Deep Dive into Data Mining Methods**
    - Implement a few models learned from this course from scratch.
    - Skeleton codes will be provided. Your work is more like "filling in blanks".
    - Each model has a point associated with it. 6 points required.
    - Write a report (pages based on points) describing your interesting findings.
    - Up to 5% bonus towards the total course grade. Roughly 1 point, 1%.
